# Hummingcat

Faster than a cat.

## Installation

### Clojars

[not yet implemented]

## Usage

First, require the project:
```clojure
(use 'hiccup.core)
(require '[hummingcat.lib :as hcat])
```

Now that we've gotten that taken care of, we can define some views. This view is intended to display the url:

```clojure
(defn display_url [url]
  (html
    [:head
      [:title "What url was that?"]]
    [:body
      [:h1 "URL"]
      [:p (str "You just requested " url)]]))
```

Now we can decide exactly which requests get which views:

```clojure
(hcat/def-handler my_hander [request]
  (hcat/get "/this_specific_url" "omg you requested this one!")
  (hcat/get #".*" (display_url (:uri request))))
```

This will take a request from the user. If it's a `GET` for the url `/this_specific_url` the user will see `omg you requested this one!`. Any other request will display the view `display_url`, including the url which they are requesting.

Lastly, we need to run the server:

```clojure
(defn -main [& args]
  (hcat/run my_handler 8000)) # Passing in the handler and the port.
```

That's hummingcat!
